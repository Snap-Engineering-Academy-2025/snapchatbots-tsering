# Combining Spotify Navigation Lab and Triviachat Lab

In this lab, we're going to be combining the two labs we worked on last week. Instead of a list of songs that can be pressed to view song details, you'll end up with a list of conversations/chatbots that can be pressed to open up that conversation!

### Setup Repository

1. Click "Use as Template" and use the name "snapchatbots-yourname"
2. Clone from your new repo into your desired folder with terminal
3. Open the project code in VSCode (use `code .` if you can)
4. Open terminal in the VSCode window then run `npm install` to install packages
5. Launch the project with `npx expo start`

You do not need to setup Spotify because the "songs" are now chatbots!
